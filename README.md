This is used for the hosting the server listing without having the need to rely on Ne4to. While he is a cool guy, the server listing is being ran by him (from what I’ve gathered) and him alone. To show my frustration at the wait of one individual that controls who and how long it takes to even get on the community listing alone, I present the result of having make my own server listing.

If you want to use this server listing to get players to join, then a requirement must be met.
1)	You must make an issue (which soon will migrate to using Pull Requests later) and report if you intend to have it listed under the “official” or “community” server listing. You must also report the IP:PORT of the server you want listed too.
2)	Have your users download the patch file to patch their game.exe using XDelta or provide an already patched game.exe

Fulfilling either or both requirements allow you to use this server listing.
